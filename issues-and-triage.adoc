This page describes how we track issues in JIRA for Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces.

## Issue Triage

New issues are automatically assigned to a component owner when one is set **_at the time the issue is created_**.

Issues created **_without a component or assignee_** need to be reviewed by a project committer (triage curator) who will set:

* component(s), 
* label(s), 
* affects version(s), 
* release note related fields/flags, incuding writer if known, 
* priority/severity.

If known at the time of triage, curator can also set:

* fix version and
* assignee. 


### Triage process

All issues in the following JIRA filters should be reviewed daily by a curator so that the queries return no results.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12405236[Issues with no component]
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12405933[Issues with need-triage labels]

Additionally, these queries should be checked regularly to ensure the number of issues is decreasing over time.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12405937[Issues with need-PM/Support-triage label]
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12405235[Issues with customer or cee labels]
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12405237[Issues with no assignee]
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12405233[Issues with no fix version]
* link:https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12405238[Security issues with no fix version]

You can add issue counts per query here:

* link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q5AV0BU8RZqAwJ2GaEX0k5iZBRK2FJTXzz-2-vfBVTs/edit?usp=sharing[Issue triage stats]

Steps to triage an issue:

. Verify:
    - The issue is not a **duplicate**
    - The issue has **all the needed information**
    - If the issue is a bug, it must include:
        * **steps to reproduce it**
        * **product and platform versions & workspace details** (OCP, Dev Spaces, devfile/project/sample used)
    - If the issue is not a bug:
        * the issue type must be set correctly (Task, QE Task, Enhancement, Epic, etc.)
. Set a **component** so the issue will be seen by the relevant people
. Set any relevant **labels** to assist sprint planning, prioritization, and review by Docs, PM, CEE, and other stakeholders
. Set **Affects Version** if not set but the issue description implies it

For some issues, you may be able to add even more information:

. Set **Assignee** if not set and work will begin immediately; remove assignee if work is not scheduled
. Set **Fix Version** if known/obvious; empty and "3.x" versions can be set to a more concrete value during sprint planning
. Set **Priority** if default “major” is not correct.

[NOTE]
====
Don't change priority if the issue has a label `need-PM/Support-triage`. Instead, talk to the Product Manager or Support person for the related product (Dev Spaces, DWO, or WTO). You can message on Slack if they're online, or leave a comment on the JIRA for them if they're not.

[NOTE]
====
- label `cee_high` has priority = [mostly `Critical`, but could be `Blocker`]
- label `cee_medium` has priority = [mostly `Major`, but could be `Critical`]
- label `cee_low` has priority = `Major` or lower

. Set **release note fields** if relevant:
    - Affects: Release Notes
    - Release Note Text
    - Release Note Type
    - Release Note Status = Proposed, Rejected, None
    - Writer (if known)

. In general, if you're not sure what to do, ask in Slack @ link:https://app.slack.com/client/T027F3GAJ/C011LSD1R4M[#forum-devspaces] or link:https://app.slack.com/client/T027F3GAJ/C04L0QR0P09[@team-devspaces]. 
+
Or, try one of these approaches:

    - Set the `need-triage` label so the next triager can review
    - Set the `need-PM/Support-triage` label if PM or Support should review
    - Ask for more info from the reporter and @mention them
    - If reporter is an authorised member of the CRW JIRA, assign issue to the reporter

### Notification of triage results

At the end of their working day the curator reports the triage summary in Slack @ link:https://app.slack.com/client/T027F3GAJ/C011LSD1R4M[#forum-devspaces]

The same person should do link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Issue-Tracking#triage-process[upstream] and downstream triage that day.

### Triage curators


See link:https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Issue-Tracking#triage-curators[Triage curators] for the latest rota.

### Triage FAQ

**Should the curator try to reproduce all the issues?**

The curator doesn’t have the time to reproduce every issue. If reproducing an issue takes more than 15 min they should delegate it to a team. This is done through proper issue labeling, setting a component, and setting an assignee to review the issue. 

**Should the curator set the issue milestone?**

The curator should not set the fixversion but, if the issue is a blocker, it *must* be part of the current release. If not a blocker, fix version will depend on the team's bandwidth and on the risk of regression. If the curator is not able to determine if an issue is a blocker, they should ask questions on slack.
